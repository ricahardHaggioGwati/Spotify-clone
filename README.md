# Spotify clone

## Overview

This is a clone of the Spotify landing page. It is a duplicate of the original page that can be found [here](https://www.spotify.com/za-en/premium/?_ga=2.133644686.1624025122.1657265731-1388336345.1655642287&_gac=1.120122874.1657024033.CjwKCAjwwo-WBhAMEiwAV4dyba2zBPO1V0-7VkFVs8HEPqp4JGLsykztIjiQ5VW8Vg9DjWc9LUi-5RoC_PQQAvD_BwE). This page has really demostrated the power of the [React](https://reactjs.org/) framework along side [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/create-next-app).

## Dependencies

## Additional Information

Building this project really demonstrated the need for a CSS framework like [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/). The overall amount of CSS that is used in this project is quite small but becomes increasingly complex as the project grows. I really want to continue to improve the CSS and add more features to it. I will continue to work on this project as I learn more about the Tailwind framework. I want to make it as close as possible to the original Spotify page.

## Contributing

I would love any and all feedback on this project. I am open to any and all suggestions on how to improve this project.

Happy coding! üõ©Ô∏è
